      <p>I am working towards pursuing a career that I can enjoy, but can also benefit from. At one point in life, I had to do everything on my own, and I was not even twelve. It lasted for about 6 to 10 months. Sometimes, I am glad I had to go through it because I can do many things I wouldn't even want to do today, if I hadn't had to learn to be independent. Some short-term goals I hope to accomplish are participating in extracurricular activities, planning out college, improving my GPA, and completing assignments early. I am working towards these goals by trying to keep my grades and social status good, so I can have more options and opportunities at different things with different people. I've also tried out new things from time to time and some of those experiences have helped give me an idea of what I do enjoy and what I don't. I consider strength to be most necessary for my success. I must continue to push forward even if things get too tough for me. If I don't try hard enough, I won't reach my goal and then become disappointed. Throughout my career, I would like to be known for doing my best and encouraging others to do their best as well. </p>
